The project is now runnable on StrongCompute. 
There are room for optimization.

To run the project : 
* First set up the remote connection.
* git clone the repository
* pip install requirements.txt
* Run the mnist_factory.py to set up the datasets (make sure .csv files are there ; we can use StrongCompute Datasets as well???)
* isc train fashion_mnist.isc
