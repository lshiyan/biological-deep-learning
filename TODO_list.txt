- More seperation of concerns (hidden, input, output -> layers + mlp should work with any type of model)
- Debug model performance
- Finish documentation of entire code
- Determine where to get the hyperparameters and code it accordingly
- Makes sure all functionality are useful and actually do smt
- Write set_scheduler() in the layers
